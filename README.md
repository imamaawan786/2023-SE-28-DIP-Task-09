Task 9
Create a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to conduct a detailed color image analysis on a user-provided image. The program should:

Allow the user to upload an image during runtime.

Convert the uploaded image to grayscale and display both the original and grayscale images.

Extract and visualize the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels individually.

Transform the image into multiple color spaces including HSV, YCbCr, and Lab, and display each version.

Perform white balance correction using the Gray World assumption and display the corrected image.

Apply color masking in the HSV color space to isolate a specific color (for example, green).

Implement a simple segmentation technique in another color space (like thresholding on the Lab a channel) and compare how segmentation results vary across different color spaces through visual inspection.
